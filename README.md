# Dataset T42

## BIB-R

BIB-R is the first benchmark for evaluating the FRBRization process. It is composed of two datasets (T42 and BIB-RCAT) and a set of evaluation metrics. The goal of the first dataset is to identify the weak and strong points of a tool by testing all possible issues that libraries may face during FRBRization. The second dataset BIB-RCAT is extracted from catalogs of three different cultural institutions and can be used for comparing or experimenting with the data quality and size of data that typically is found in real world catalogs. The expected FRBR results (gold standard) are included in these datasets to enable evaluation.

## T42

T42 has been built for benchmarking FRBRization solutions which deal with MARC records. The dataset is composed by 42 different tests. Each test can relates a specific FRBR pattern representation and can include specific issues.
