# Benchmark of FRBRization solutions

This repository provides two datasets (T42 and BIB-RCAT) dedicated to the evaluation of the FRBRization process. The goal of the first dataset T42 is to identify the weak and strong points of a tool by testing all possible issues that libraries may face during FRBRization. The second dataset BIB-RCAT is extracted from catalogs of three different cultural institutions and can be used for comparing or experimenting with the data quality and size of data that typically is found in real world catalogs. The expected FRBR results (gold standard) are included in these datasets to enable evaluation. The MARC catalogs are provided in MARC/XML format while the FRBR collections are available in RDF/XML (Generated by the Jena API).

## T42
T42 has been built for benchmarking FRBRization solutions which deal with MARC records. The dataset is composed by 42 different tests. Each test can relates a specific FRBR pattern representation and can include specific issues.

## BIB-RCAT
BIB-RCAT is a dataset of MARC21 records accompanied by the FRBR version to evaluate a FRBRization solution.
